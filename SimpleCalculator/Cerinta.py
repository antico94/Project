Implement the main calculator logic

Implement simple_calculator() to create the calculator. The function continuously asks for number 'a' and 'b' and an operator and calculates the result of
'a' 'operator' 'b'.
The function checks the validity of the operands and the operator. Exit from the program if the 'a' operand is not valid. In case of valid 'a' operand, the
 function ensures the operand 'b' and the operator is valid.
The function prints the calculation results, e.g.: 'The result is 10'.
General requirements
None

Hints
You need a function for asking input number from the user. For the first number request, non-number input is acceptable (this will trigger the exit from the program), but for the second input request is not allowed. You can distinguishes between the two case with a boolean variable.
Create a helper function called input, which will contain the Scanner. It is a good idea to outsource all functionality that is used more than once.
