List ideas
Add the option to list all the existing ideas without adding a new one with command line argument --list.

Calling the program with the command line argument --delete and a number deletes the idea corresponding to the number and prints out the list of the ideas with leading numbers (e.g. 1. first idea)
Not giving any arguments after the --delete argument prints out the error message Specify a number after --delete
Giving non-number arguments after the --delete argument prints out the error message Specify a number after --delete
Giving more command line arguments is ignored by the program"""
