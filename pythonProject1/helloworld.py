Hello, World!











6.Hints
If you know how to compile your source and then how to run your class files from the command line, you are very close to writing a starter script. Here are the steps to follow:
Create a new file in a text editor and name it as required (make.sh / make.ps1).
If you are using Linux, put #!/bin/sh as the first line (this tells the system how to run this file).
Copy the two commands into the next two lines that you used for compilation and running.
Save it, and make the script file runnable on your OS.
Run it!
Try to fix the above script to pass an "outside" argument to the command that starts your application. You can find more about this in the Background materials section.
